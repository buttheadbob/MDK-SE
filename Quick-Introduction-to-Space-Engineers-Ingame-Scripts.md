This is a simplistic attempt to explain the various parts of an ingame script and how it works. It is by no means a complete explanation. To get further help, I recommend connecting to [Keen's official Discord](https://discord.gg/0hIE7GirODUqhfIg) and asking in the **#programming-in-game** channel. There's usually plenty of people there to help you. I will be assuming that you're familiar with the game itself, and how to _use_ scripts, and how to load a script into a programmable block via the workshop button.

### The Language

First of all: The programmable block uses the programming language C# in order to provide high-performance automation for your builds. Before continuing you should get a basic grasp of the language itself. There are several tutorials on the web dealing with this, including [Microsoft's own](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/csharp). You might be able to find some tutorials which are better at explaining than them though, they tend to be rather obtuse. In the following tutorials I will be assuming at least a basic grasp of C#. If you find I don't explain some things well enough, please let me know - I might try to improve it.
