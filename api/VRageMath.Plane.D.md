```csharp[float](System.Single) D```##### Summary

The distance of the Plane along its normal from the origin. Note: Be careful! The distance is signed and is the opposite of what people usually expect. If you look closely at the plane equation: (n dot P) - D = 0, you'll realize that D = - (n dot P) (that is, negative instead of positive)
