# MDK-SE
(Malware's Development Kit for SE)

----

**WARNING** Still prerelease and buggy. Not ready for general use yet!

----

A toolkit to help with ingame script (programmable block) development for Keen Software House's space sandbox Space Engineers. It helps you create a ready-to-code project for writing ingame scripts, and provides an analyzer which warns you if you're trying to use something that is not allowed in Space Engineers. It also provides a code minifier to make your deployed script as small as possible - albeit somewhat unreadable.

Space Engineers is trademarked to Keen Software House. This toolkit is fan-made, and its developer has no relation to Keen Software House.

## Important Note
This is a project I pretty much made for _myself_. I'm publishing it in case someone else might have a use for it. Fair warning: Make requests, by all means, but if your request is not something I myself have any use for, someone else is gonna have to do the work. I'm fully employed, and this is a spare-time project. I'll be working on it on and off.

## Contribution
Yeah, sure. Absolutely. I will gladly accept contribution to the project. I'll be grateful for any assistance, especially for any features requested that I myself may not have any use for. I have only limited time for this project, and I am forced - for the most part - to stick to features that I myself will be using. This means that any extra features, like for instance mod support, relies on the community contributing. However: I can't merge contributions willy nilly. I will expect a certain minimum standard, and I reserve the right to deny features I don't like. Another fair warning :D
