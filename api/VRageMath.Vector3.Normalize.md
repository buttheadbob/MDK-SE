[float](System.Single) Normalize()

## Summary

Turns the current vector into a unit vector. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

[Vector3](VRageMath.Vector3) Normalize([Vector3](VRageMath.Vector3) value)

## Summary

Creates a unit vector from the specified vector. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

[Vector3](VRageMath.Vector3) Normalize([Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) value)

void Normalize(ref [Vector3](VRageMath.Vector3) value, ref [Vector3](VRageMath.Vector3) result)

## Summary

Creates a unit vector from the specified vector, writing the result to a user-specified variable. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.
