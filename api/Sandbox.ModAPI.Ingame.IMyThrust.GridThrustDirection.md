```csharp[Vector3I](VRageMath.Vector3I) GridThrustDirection```##### Summary

Gets the direction of thrust, relative to ship controller (cockpit).

##### Remarks

For example, a value of [Forward](VRageMath.Vector3I.Forward) means the thruster will move the grid along the grid's forward direction. A value of Vector3D.Zero means direction is unknown (no cockpit available).
