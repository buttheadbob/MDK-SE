```csharp[Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) Reject([Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) vector, [Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) direction)```##### Summary

Returns the rejection of vector from direction, i.e. projection of vector onto the plane defined by origin and direction

##### Returns

Rejection of the vector from the given direction

```csharpvoid Reject(ref [Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) vector, ref [Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) direction, ref [Vector3D](VRageMath.Vector3D) result)```##### Summary
