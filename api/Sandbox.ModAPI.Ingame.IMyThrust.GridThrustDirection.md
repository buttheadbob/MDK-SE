public virtual public sealed struct Vector3I GridThrustDirection { ; }
```

Gets the direction of thrust, relative to ship controller (cockpit).

### Returns

### Example

### Remarks

For example, a value of [Forward](VRageMath.Vector3I.Forward) means the thruster will move the grid along the grid's forward direction. A value of Vector3D.Zero means direction is unknown (no cockpit available).
