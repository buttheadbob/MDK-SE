### Malware's Development Kit for Space Engineers

A toolkit to help with ingame script (programmable block) development for Keen Software House's space sandbox Space Engineers. It helps you create a ready-to-code project for writing ingame scripts, and provides an analyzer which warns you if you're trying to use something that is not allowed in Space Engineers. It also provides a code minifier to make your deployed script as small as possible - albeit somewhat unreadable.

Space Engineers is trademarked to Keen Software House. This toolkit is fan-made, and its developer has no relation to Keen Software House.

## Important Note
This is a project I pretty much made for _myself_. I'm publishing it in case someone else might have a use for it. Fair warning: Make requests, by all means, but if your request is not something I myself have any use for, someone else is gonna have to do the work. I'm fully employed, and this is a spare-time project. I'll be working on it on and off.

## Contribution
Yeah, sure. Absolutely. I will gladly accept contribution to the project. I'll be grateful for any assistance, especially for any features requested that I myself may not have any use for. I have only limited time for this project, and I am forced - for the most part - to stick to features that I myself will be using. This means that any extra features, like for instance mod support, relies on the community contributing. However: I can't merge contributions willy nilly. I will expect a certain minimum standard, and I reserve the right to deny features I don't like. Another fair warning :D

## About Me
Ok, so who is this Malware guy anyway, and why the heck does a software engineer use a nickname based on malicious software? Can I even trust this person?

Well, yes, I promise you can. The nickname is chosen deliberately, both as a sarcastic reference to said malicious software that I hate as much as anyone, and a play on words. You see, my real name initials are MAL, and I am a software engineer through and through, both by vocation and hobby. Mal + [soft]ware = Malware. Cheesy? Oh, yes, absolutely, but I like it.

Like I said, a software engineer through and through. I have been programming since my very early teens (or maybe before, I can't remember exactly). I wrote my first piece of software somewhere between 25 and 30 years ago alongside my father, with a then brand-new 80286 computer. We used [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC). Well, technically, he actually wrote it, I suggested and watched with big eyes. That sparked my unending love for programming, and I never looked back. I am now a professional business software programmer, and I've been in my current job for a decade. I love this job.

Oh, I guess I should also mention that I'm the author of the current version of Space Engineer's programmable block. To be exact, it's compiler. That is my main contribution, but I have also contributed smaller things here and there.

I hope this is enough information to help you trust me despite my chosen nickname!
