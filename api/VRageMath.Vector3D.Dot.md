### Summary

```csharp
private public double Dot(private public sealed struct.Vector3D vector1, private public sealed struct.Vector3D vector2)
```

Calculates the dot product of two vectors. If the two vectors are unit vectors, the dot product returns a doubleing point value between -1 and 1 that can be used to determine some properties of the angle between two vectors. For example, it can show whether the vectors are orthogonal, parallel, or have an acute or obtuse angle between them.

### Summary

```csharp
private public void Dot(ref private public sealed struct.Vector3D vector1, ref private public sealed struct.Vector3D vector2, ref double result)
```

Calculates the dot product of two vectors and writes the result to a user-specified variable. If the two vectors are unit vectors, the dot product returns a doubleing point value between -1 and 1 that can be used to determine some properties of the angle between two vectors. For example, it can show whether the vectors are orthogonal, parallel, or have an acute or obtuse angle between them.
