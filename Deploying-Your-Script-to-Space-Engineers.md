When you want to test your script, you will need to deploy it to Space Engineers. This process will combine all your [utility and extension classes](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki/Utility-Class-or-Extension-Class%3F) together and create one complete script ready for Space Engineers to use. 

There are a couple of ways to deploy your script, depending on your requirements. Usually you'll want to deploy just one single script project. In fact, most of you will probably _have_ just a single script project in your solution. To deploy a single project, you right-click the project in question in the **Solution Explorer**, then select **Deploy MDK Script**.

If you have a solution with many projects, you may want to deploy all of them at once. You can do that by right-clicking on the topmost solution node instead of the individual project node.
